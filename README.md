## What did I change?

All that I did to the source code was remove everything exept src and package.json, then I put the package.json in the src folder.


# How to install?
The first thing you need is Node.js
Then download this, cd into the folder, do npm install, then you can do node index.js.
Then you are done, you can adjust all the settings in config.json!
